An Autohotkey Tan-Tadi-Taz-TaLa Script by Aleksandr Mamajevs

This Autohotkey scritpt allows you to copy and paste a bit more easier and faster, 
as well as other operations.
The main hotkeys are:

Tab + Top1 - Copy;
Tab + Top2 - Paste;
Tab + Top3 - Cut;
Tab + Top4 - Select All;
Tab + Q - Shift + Backspace (Delete Edges);
Tab + W - Delete;
Tab + E - Select one letter to the Left;
Tab + R - Select one letter to the Right;
Tab + C - Select one word to the Left;
Tab + V - Select one word to the Right;
Tab + Z - Undo last operation (Ctrl - Z);
Tab + X - Asterix mark, for select all files (Numpad*) in some programs;
Tab + B - Numpad Minus (-), for Unselect all files  in some programs;
Tab + A - Two Zeros;
Tab + F - Send Dot (.);
Tab + S - Enter;
Tab + D - Enter;

Shift + Tab - Shift + Tab;
Alt + F4 - F11 (if you press Alt + F4 accidentally. Do not worry any more about any program would be closed by mistake.);
F4 - F11 (if you press F4 accidentally. Do not worry any more about any program would be closed by mistake.);

CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + WIN + F12 - for Quick Script Exit;
ScrollLock - for Quick Suspend Script Toggle;

Instead of having to press Ctrl again and again before each operation, all you need: just press Tab key once then hold it, when you press any other key from this list. 

My suggestion is - to remember such simple expression:
Ta-n, Ta-di, Ta-z, Ta-La - that is for Copy, Paste, Cut, Select All.

Ta-n - is for Tab + One;
Ta-di - is for Tab + Two (Duo, Di)
Ta-z - is for Tab + Top3 (The trees are growing in the ZOO.)
Ta-La - is for Tab + ALL (to select ALL)

All others hotkeys is not necessary to memorize at all. I've put them here as an example.
This expression (this hotkeys) are working, if you copy text from one window to another, as well. Just remember - you do not need to release the TAB key each time, and press it again. Even if you are working with two windows (two text documents)!

Good Luck!
