# AutoHotkey Copy-Paste TanTadiTaz Script v.2.0 README.md

## 🌙 **Origin Story: From Spilled Juice to Space Technology**
*How an accident led to a revolutionary discovery*

Sometimes great discoveries happen by accident. One day I spilled juice on my keyboard. After extensive cleaning, the bottom left keys — Ctrl, Alt, and Shift — remained sticky. While researching the problem, I learned: these exact keys are always the first to suffer from liquid damage. This mishap pushed me to write code that unexpectedly became a true breakthrough. Now I use it practically all the time.

**Forget about bottom keys forever!** No more Ctrl, Alt, Shift — only the top row of your keyboard: Tab + numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. What's at the bottom — we ignore, what's at the top — we use to the fullest! Especially indispensable in darkness — evening, night, or when you simply can't see the keyboard. Your fingers will always find the large Tab key and the top row of numbers.

Think about it: an astronaut in zero gravity reaches only for the upper, easily accessible keys. Tab+1 — that's the top row, the most obvious place on the keyboard. During smoke conditions on a space station or any emergency situation with limited visibility, the hand intuitively finds the upper keys. Add oxygen deprivation when the brain works poorly? The simple mantra **"Ta-n, Ta-di, Ta-z, Ta-La"** — like a light song, will surface from memory and help copy and transmit critically important information.

## Structure by Groups:

### 🚀 **Quick Start**
*Only top row — only simplicity*

Imagine: you work only with the upper keys of the keyboard! Hold Tab and press numbers — everything happens in one zone, under one hand. **The bottom keys Ctrl, Alt, Shift are no longer needed** — forget about them forever. Perfect for working in darkness when the hand intuitively finds the top row.

**Remember the mantra (top row only!):** Ta-n, Ta-di, Ta-z, Ta-La
- **Ta-n** (Tab+1) — Copy (oNe)
- **Ta-di** (Tab+2) — Paste (Duo/Double)
- **Ta-z** (Tab+3) — Cut (cutZ)
- **Ta-La** (Tab+4) — Select All (aLL)

### ⚙️ **Core Operations**
*Everything in the upper part of the keyboard*

Revolutionary approach: **we use only upper keys**, which are always at hand. Tab becomes a universal modifier, and all commands are the top row of letters and numbers. The system automatically understands context. Especially convenient in the evening when eyes are tired — the hand naturally finds upper keys.

**Text Editing (top row of letters):**
- `Tab + Q` — Delete Edges (Shift + Backspace)
- `Tab + W` — Delete
- `Tab + Z` — Undo
- `Tab + S/D` — Enter

**Navigation and Selection (middle row — also easy to find):**
- `Tab + E` — Select one letter to the Left
- `Tab + R` — Select one letter to the Right
- `Tab + C` — Select one word to the Left
- `Tab + V` — Select one word to the Right

### 🎯 **Special Features**
*Additional capabilities — all up there*

The script includes protection from accidental keypresses and special commands for file operations. **Same principle: we work only with the upper part of the keyboard**, forgetting about the existence of bottom modifiers.

**File Operations:**
- `Tab + X` — Select all files (Numpad*)
- `Tab + B` — Deselect all (Numpad-)
- `Tab + A` — Insert "00"
- `Tab + F` — Insert dot (.)

**Protection and Control:**
- `Alt + F4` → F11 (close protection)
- `ScrollLock` — Suspend Script Toggle
- `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Win+F12` — Emergency Exit (the only exception)

### 💡 **How It Works**
*Philosophy of the top row*

The script uses a revolutionary approach: **all work happens in the upper part of the keyboard**. Tab becomes the only modifier you need. Quick press — regular Tab, hold down — command activator with upper keys.

**Example workflow (top only!):**
1. Hold Tab (large key on the left)
2. In Window1: double-click on word → press "1" (top row)
3. Switch to Window2: click where needed → press "2" (top row)
4. Press "S" for new line (middle row, but still easy)
5. Repeat — speed x2-x4!

### 🌌 **Universal Application**
*From home computer to space station*

This script was born from the necessity to work without bottom keys and turned into a universal solution. **The top row is the universal comfort zone:**
- **For elderly people** — no need to search for small keys at the bottom
- **For night work** — hand intuitively finds the top row
- **For emergencies** — the most accessible keys are always at the top
- **For space missions** — easier to reach the top of the keyboard in zero gravity

### ⚠️ **Important Notes**
*What you need to know before using*

- **Alt+Tab temporarily unavailable** when script is active (use ScrollLock to suspend)
- Script can be edited in any text editor to suit your needs
- Works equally effectively with text and files
- **Main advantage:** complete abandonment of bottom modifier keys

## 🎭 **Conclusion**

What started as a solution to a spilled keyboard problem turned into an elegant tool using only the upper part of the keyboard. **Bottom keys are dead — long live the top row!** When it's dark, when eyes are tired, when maximum speed is needed, or when every movement counts — your hand automatically finds Tab and the numbers at the top.

The simple song **"Ta-n, Ta-di, Ta-z, Ta-La"** — it's all top row, always at hand. Whether you're a student in a dorm working at night, an elderly person with poor vision, or an astronaut in an emergency — the upper keys will never fail. Because genius is always simple and always at the top!
